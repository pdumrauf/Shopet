				<li>Can I place an order over the phone?</li>
				<p>Yes, we love chatting with our customers. 
				Please call our Customer Service team (run by real people!) on +54 9 0000 0000 between 9am to 6pm 7 days a week. Alternatively you can email us at hello@shopetfamily.com and we will reply the same day.</p>
				<li>What payment methods are accepted in store?</li>
				<p>We accept all major credit and debit cards in store. You are also welcome to pay by cash.</p>
				<li>How do I set a repeat order?</li>
				<p>The Pets Corner repeat delivery service allows you to schedule your order to repeat at a frequency of your choosing. We'll repeatedly deliver your pet food order and any other items you need on a regular basis. How do I set up this service?</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Find your pet's favourite food or treats.</li>
						<li>Select your preferred size and quantity.</li>
						<li>Choose the frequency of your repeat delivery e.g. every 2 weeks, every 4 weeks, etc.</li>
						<li>Click "repeat delivery"</li>
					</ol>
				<p>You can view your scheduled delivery from your Pets Corner account page where you will be given the option to change the frequency of your delivery or cancel at any stage. Please note that you will be billed automatically on the date the repeat order is scheduled for.</p>
				<li>Can I return something purchased in store?</li>
				<p>If you are unhappy with any product sold to you, we will always endeavour to find a solution either by offering an exchange or a refund, with valid proof of purchase. We also offer a 100% guarantee on everything that we sell in store.
				If you have purchased something you no longer want, you can return this for a refund or exchange within 28 days providing it is clean and still in the original packaging, with valid proof of purchase.
				If you wish to return a toy because it has been chewed, we can offer an exchange, but not a refund. Most of the toys we sell are made to be fun and are not designed to withstand lots of chewing; the only exception would be a toy that claimed on the packaging to be ‘tough’ but was destroyed or damaged. This can be exchanged as a gesture of good will.
				If a product becomes faulty within 6 months, we will be able to offer an exchange or a refund with valid proof of purchase, after 6 months up until 12 months (unless otherwise stated) we will be able to offer an exchange with valid proof of purchase.</p>
